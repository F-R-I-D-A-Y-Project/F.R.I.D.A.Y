Python project developed for the discipline "Laboratório de Programação 2", at "Instituto Militar de Engenharia"

## About 

F.R.I.D.A.Y is a chatbot and personal assistant AI developed in Python. Capable of answering question made by user and executing shell commands for the user. It was developed using the Transformers architecture, and 
it is serialized so the model doesn't need to be trained every time
